  <p>International Business Machines Corporation (using the trademark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Machines" title="International Business Machines">IBM®</a>), nicknamed Big Blue,<sup><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> is an American multinational
    technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, and present in over 175 countries.<sup><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> It is a publicly traded company 
    and one of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.<sup><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the world,
    with 19 research facilities across a dozen countries; for 29 consecutive years, from 1993 to 2021, it held the 
    record for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business.</p>

  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM" title="IBM">IBM</a> was founded in 1911 as the

    of record-keeping and measuring systems. It was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924 and soon became
    the leading manufacturer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card" title="Punch-card tabulating systems">punch-card tabulating systems</a>. During the 1960s and 1970s, the IBM mainframe, exemplified
    by the System/360 and its successors, was the world's dominant 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform" title="Computing platform">computing platform</a>, with the company producing 80 percent
    of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide.<sup><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Embracing both business and scientific computing, System/360
    was the first family of computers designed to cover a complete range of applications from small to large.<sup><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>IBM originated with several technological innovations developed and commercialized in the late 19th century.
     Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885;<sup><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);<sup><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine (1889);<sup><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> and Willard Bundy invented a 
     time clock to record workers' arrival and departure times on a paper tape (1889).<sup><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> On June 16, 1911,
      their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company,
       the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York.<sup><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> The five companies
        had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit,
         Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Canada.<sup><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

  <p>The Nazis made extensive use of Hollerith punch card and alphabetical accounting equipment and IBM's majority‑owned
       German subsidiary, Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen GmbH (Dehomag), supplied this equipment from the early 1930s. 
       This equipment was critical to Nazi efforts to categorize citizens of both Germany and other nations that fell
        under Nazi control through ongoing censuses. These census data were used to facilitate the round‑up of Jews 
        and other targeted groups, and to catalog their movements through the machinery of the Holocaust, including 
        internment in the concentration camps.<sup><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Black contends that IBM's dealings with Nazis through its New York 
        City headquarters persisted during World War II.<sup><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Nazi concentration camps operated a Hollerith department 
        called Hollerith Abteilung, which had IBM machines, including calculating and sorting machines.<sup><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

  <h2>Corporate affairs</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>IBM's market capitalization was valued at over $153 billion as of May 2024.<sup><a href="#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup> Despite its relative decline 
      within the technology sector,<sup><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup> IBM remains the seventh largest technology company by revenue, and 67th
       largest overall company by revenue in the United States. IBM ranked No. 38 on the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings
        of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.<sup><a href="#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup> In 2014, IBM was accused of using "financial
         engineering" to hit its quarterly earnings targets rather than investing for the longer term.<sup><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup></p>
